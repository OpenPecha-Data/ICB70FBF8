The Great Páramitá Heart Sútra
----------
----------
Avalokiteśwara (The Devatā of the Sūtra). When the Prajnā Pāramitā has been fully practised, then clearly behold that the five skandhas are all empty, vain, and unreal. So it is we escape the possibility of sorrow or obstruction.

Śāriputra (The Rishi of the Sūtra). That which we call form (rūpa) is not different from that which we call space (ākāśa). Space is not different from form. Form is the same as space. Space is the same as form.
And so with the other skandhas, whether vedanā, or sanjnā, or sanskāra, or vijñāna, (they are each the same as their opposite).
Śāriputra. All these things around us (ye dhammā) being thus stript or devoid of qualities (lakshaṅa [sic]), there can be no longer birth or death, defilement or purity, addition or destruction.In the midst then on this void (ākāśa), there can be neither rūpa, vedanā, sanjnā, sanskāra, or vijnāna (i.e., neither of the five skandha),nor yet organs of sense, whether the eye, or nose, ear, or tongue, body of mind (chitta),nor yet objects of sense, i.e. matter (rūpa), or sound, odour, or taste, touch, or ideas (chaitta),nor yet categories of sense (dhātu), such as the union of the object and subject in sight, in smell, in touch, in taste, in apprehension.
So there will be no such thing as ignorance (avdiyā), nor yet freedom from ignorance, and therefore these can be none of its consequences (viz., the twelve nidānas. Colebrooke p.255); and therefore no such thing as decay or death (jarā or maraṅa), nor yet freedom from decay and death. So neither can there be a method (or way) for destroying the concourse of sorrows. No such thing as wisdom, and no such thing as attaining (happiness or rest), as there will not be ought that can be attained.
The Bodhisatwa resting on this Prajnā Pāramitā, no sorrow of obstruction can then affect his heart, for there will be no (28) such thing as sorrow of obstruction.Therefore, having no fear or apprehension of evil, removing far from him all the distorting influences of illusive thought, he arrives at the goal of Nirvāṅa.The Buddhas of the three ages, relying on this Prajnā Pāramitā, have arrived at the “unsurpassed and enlightened” condition “samyak-sambodhi”).
Therefore know that this Prajnā Pāramitā is the the Great Spiritual Dhāraṇī,–it is the Great Light-giving Dhāraṇī. This is the unsurpassed Dhāraṇī. This is the unequalled Dhāraṇī, able to destroy all sorrows. True and real, (i.e., full of meaning), not vain (i.e., unmeaning).Therefore we repeat (or let us repeat) the Prajnā Pāramitā Dhāraṇī.Then also say–Ki-tai, Ki-tai, Po-lo, Ki-tai, Po-lo-seng-Ki-tai, Bo-tāi-sah-po-ho. i.e. [according to M. Julien’s system]: Gati Gati, Paragati, Parasangati, Bodhisatvah, [words I cannot attempt to explain.]
